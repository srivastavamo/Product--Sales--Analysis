# Product--Sales--Analysis
Sales Analysis - 

I used pivot tables to quickly investigate sales data and answer questions about business. Cleaned the dataset and turned in to interactive dashboard using power query, pivot tables, pivot charts, calculations and investigate source data In Excel

•	What are the top 5 product categories?
•	What is the average unit price for each category?
•	Who are the sales reps selling in each category?
•	Which categories make up over 50% of our total revenue?
Sales data analysis provided intelligence about sales strategy, top performing ,underperforming products , the performance of the team and which product is generating more revenue and much more.
